		<h2>Basic concepts</h2>
			<h3><a name="scene">Scene</a></h3>
				Scene (or Project) is an xml file which is loaded into the Dragon Tool. Folder in
				which this file is located called 'project root folder'. In the project root folder Dragon Tool
				automaticaly creates following folders:
				<ul>
					<li><b>autobackup</b> - every 3 minutes a backup of the scene is written in this folder.
					<li><b>bak</b>- every time you save a scene a backup scene is created here. So you can at any time
								 load a scene on which you were working two months ago.
					<li><b>sprites</b>   - in this directory png files which used by the project are located.
					<li><b>output</b>    - an output files (for example, a Mobile Dragon res file) are written here.
				</ul>
			<h3><a name="object">Scene object</a></h3>
				Every project (or a scene) consists of objects. When you create a new scene there are only three objects:
				the root object, Time object and a Grid object. During workprocess you create new objects and combine them.
				For example, importing a bitmap in a scene is just a creation of a Sprite object.
			<h3><a id="properties">Editing object properties</a></h3>
				Every object has a set of properties which can be adjusted. It is done in the Property Editor.
				<p><center><img src="img/prop_editor.png" alt="property editor screenshot"></center>
				<p>You can also add your own properties to any object in the scene. Such properties called
				"custom properties" and are useful for translating extra information from the Dragon Tool editor to
				the Mobile Dragon engine.
			<h3><a name="copies">Copies and Instances</a></h3>
				Objects can be copied on can be instanced. Copy is another independent object which can be modified
				and this modifications wouldn't affect on the initial object. On the other hand, instance
				is just the same object that can be parented to another node. When a base object is changed - an
				instance is changed in the same way.
				<p>Instance objects are shown in italic text in the outliner:
				<p><center><img src="img/instances.png" border="1">
				<p><i>Two instances of the object "door".</i></center>
				<p>Instances take much less memory than copies and work faster.
