		<h2>Working with IndexedTileMap</h2>
			This page describes the ways of creating and tuning tile maps. Today Dragon Tool has only one
			implementation of TileMap - IndexedTileMap.
		<p>
			IndexedTileMap consists of:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Palette node.</b> This node defines a set of objects that are used as tiles in this map.
				<li><b>Cell.</b> Cell defines a shape of a single tile and they layout. You can create any cell
						(rectangular, 6-sided, 8-sided or any other). Tile's layout is defined by two Point objects.
						First point defines a location of the next cell in the row, second -
						location of the next cell in the column:
					<p>
						<center><img src="img/cell.png"></center>
				<li><b>Data.</b> IndexedTileMap can be represented as a matrix or a two dimensional array.
						Every element of this matrix holds a number of an object in the palette:
					<p>
						<center><img src="img/matrix.png"></center>
					<p>
						So, changes in palette node will result in changes in the tile map.
						You can make two or more palettes for a map and then switch them.
			</ul>
			Now let's see how this works in practice.
		<p>
			Download a <a href="itm_tutorial.zip">project</a>, unpack it and load itm.xml file as a scene. There are 4 tile sets: 'palDay1', 
			'palDay2', 'palNight1' and 'palNight2' (it was created simply by importing sprites and grouping them).
			We will use this nodes
			later, 'cos for now we need Cell object. Of course we could just use isometric cell for our
			this purpose, but to understand how the cells work we will use free form cell.
			Choose "Create -> Cell" command. Set it's name 'cell1'.
			Our first map will use isometric tile 32x16. So, expand cell1 node in the Outliner panel.
			It has three objects attached. The first one is a Polygon and others a Points.
			To change a shape of a Polygon expand it and select and move it's Points.
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/itm1.png"></center>
		<p>
			You can also select the points of Polygon and change it's coords in the Property Editor.
		<p>
			Choose "Create -> IndexedTileMap" and edit it's properties. Set <b>rowCount</b> and
			<b>columnCount</b> to 7. The <b>cell</b> property should be set to '|cell1'. Set <b>palette</b> to
			'|palDay1' and turn on <b>showCells</b>. Change it's name to 'isoMap1'.
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/itm2.png"></center>
		<p>
			As we can see the cells of this map are not layed out properly. So, let's correct it.
		<p>
			Expand a cell1 node and select it's first of two points. Move it to the top vertex of the and
			see how the map changed. Then move second point to the center vertex of the cell. Now the map
			cells should be layed correctly.
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/itm3.png"></center>
		<p>
			Now we can paint a map. Select 'palDay1' node and choose "Window -> Brushes" to display the palette
			children in a separate window. Then choose 'isoMap1' and turn on "Make Live" button on the toolbar
			(or choose "Edit -> Make Live"). Then click on the brushes and paint on the map.
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/itm4.png"></center>
		<p>
			This map is a single layered. If we need some objects to be painted over this map (for example
			trees or items) than we need create another map and put over this one. Create new map,
			change it's <b>name</b> to 'isoMap2', <b>rowCount</b> and <b>columnCount</b> to 7.
			Add 'isoMap1' to selection and choose "Edit -> Group". Set
			<b>palette</b> property of 'isoMap2' to 'palDay2'. Choose "Edit -> Make Live",
			select 'palette1' node and "Window -> Brushes". Then draw flowers and then try to put a post
			near them.
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/itm5.png"></center>
		<p>
			Position of the post seems to be incorrect. And if you paint a flowers over it you'll
			see that it displayed over a post ! But from the program point of view it seems to be ok because
			the order in which map tiles are displayed is the following:
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/itm6.png"></center>
		<p>
			And probably in your game the same algorytm is used.
		<p>
			To correct this we need to adjust the position of the post relative to a cell.
			Select the 'post' object in the 'palDay1'
			node and decrease it's y coord to move it up. (Yes, an Y axis is pointing down. The same rule is used in
			Mobile Dragon).
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/itm7.png">
		<p>
			<i>Adjusting position of the post relative to a cell. For the convinience
			all the objects were hidden except the cell and the post (shown in the Outliner).</i></center>
		<p>
			Now it should be all right.
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/itm8.png"></center>
		<p>
			Let's try now to switch a palette nodes of this maps. Select 'isoMap1' and change it's <b>palette</b>
			property to '|palNight1' and set a 'isoMap2' <b>palette</b> property to '|palNight2'.
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/itm9.png"></center>
		<p>
			If you expand 'palDay1' and 'palDay2' you will see that tiles in this tile sets have the same order.
			Because of that when we changed palette of the IndexedTileMap it painted the tiles with the same
			indexes. Only palette have changed, not the data (or matrix) of the map.
		<p>
			In this tutorial we used two maps (or two layers of a single map). One for terrain and 
			another for objects. But in your game you probably will need three or more layers. To work with them
			comfortably keep in mind that you can hide some them (by turning off <b>visible</b> property).
		<p>
			Also if you'll need a more complex cell you just adjust a location of the points of the cell and add
			or remove Points to the Polygon object to change it's shape.
