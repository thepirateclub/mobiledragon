		<h2>Quick start</h2>
			This tutorial will show an overview of the main Dragon Tool features.
			It's divided in a few steps. You can pass any step and continue from another
			one by loading according scene. This scenes are located in the zip archive
			(<a href="quick_start.zip">download scenes</a>).
		<p>
			Let's assume that we are making some RPG project. Out first task will be to
			compose a panel where the action points of the game character and his
			items and weapon is shown.
			
		<h3><a id="step1"></a> Step 1. Loading a scene</h3>
			Start by loading scene quick_start/tutorial/step1.xml<br>
			
		<h3><a id="step2"></a> Step 2. Importing bitmap images</h3>
			There are no sprites in this scene, so let's import some by
			choosing "Sprite -> Import" menu item.<br>
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/file_chooser.png"></center>
		<p>
			For now we need the following bitmaps: apGreen, dragon, itemSlot and panelTile.
		<h3><a id="step3"></a>Step 3. Placing and grouping sprites</h3>
			After import they will appear in the project. In the Outliner Panel
			you can see that this objects are selected:
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/outliner1.png"></center>
		<p>
			Then we will create an object that will group these elements in the needed order.
			(Create -> Transform). This object will be named "Transform6" or something like
			that. To rename it go to the table in the right part of the window (It's called
			"Property Editor". There you can edit properties of selected objects) and
			change the "name" property. Let's call it "panel":
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/prop_editor.png"></center>
		<p>
			Now we can start composing the panel. In the outliner window drag
			a "panelTile" object on the "panel" object. "panelTile" object will
			be attached to a "panel". Then attach an "itemSlot" and a "dragon"
			objects to the "panel". Go to the Property Editor and set the panel's
			'x' coord to 100, so we can se it separately from other objects in the scene.
		<p>
			Let's arrange interface elements and adjust they Z order. Select a
			panelTile in the Outliner window and set it's ZOrder to 0. Then select
			an itemSlot and set it's ZOrder to 1, x coord to 128 and it's y coord
			to -5. Then set a dragon's ZOrder to 2, x and y coords to 11 and -16.
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/panel1.png"></center>
		<p>
			We need two itemSlots on the panel. So, select an itemSlot and
			choose "Edit -> Copy" command. Set the newly created object's ZOrder
			to 3 and x coord to 19.
		<p>
			Panel is nearly completed. We just need to layout an action points idicators.
		<p>
			Select an apGreen and attach it to the panel. Set it's
			ZOrder to 4 and coords to 53 and -2. Copy it and move the copy
			to the right using a Move Tool on the toolbar.
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/move_tool.png"></center>
		<p>
			Perform the same actions to make two more ap indicators. The
			result of our work shoul look in the following way:
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/panel_finished.png"></center>
		
		<h3><a id="step4"></a> Step 4. Creating tile map</h3>
			For creating a tile map firstly we should create a cell object for this grid.
		<p>
			Choose "Create -> Square Cell" command. Change the 'size' property of this cell to 24 pixels.
		<p>
			Choose "Create -> Index Tile Map". After the map is created look at
			it's properties in the Property Editor. The most impotant ones are
			"cellNode", "palette", "rowCount", "colCount". "cellNode" property should be
			already defined. If not - set it to "|cell". Set "rowCount"
			and "colCount" to 8. You can also set "showCells" to look at the grid of cells.
			Call this object "terrainMap". And let's also hide a panel by selecting it and
			unchecking the "visible" property.
			<p><center><img src="img/empty_tile_map.png"></center>
		<p>
			For now the grid is clear. Let's import some tiles for this map.
			Go to the "Sprite -> Import" and choose following sprites: grass, grass_left,
			grass_topLeft, grass_top, sand. Then group them ("Edit -> Group"), call
			this group "terrainTiles" and uncheck it's "visible" property. This
			group of objects will be used to paint them	on our tile map.
			Then we should tell a terrainMap that it should use this group of objects as a
			tile set. Select it and set it's "palette" property to "|terrainTiles".
		<p>
			Now we can paint this map. Select a terrainTiles object and
			choose "Window -> Display Brushes". Select a map and press a "Make Live"
			button on the toolbar to allow
			painting on this object <img src="img/make_live.png">(Live object is an
			object on which the painting is performed). Then click on the brushes and
			draw a on the map some terrain.
		<p>
			<center><img src="img/tile_map.png"></center>
		<p>
			When finished, select terrainMap and press "Make Live" button again to
			disable painting on it.
			
		<h3><a id="step5"></a>Step 5. Placing objects on the map</h3>
			The map looks empty. So, let's paint some trees and stones over it.
			Import the following sprites: stone, tree1_top, tree1_bottom, tree2_botLeft,
			tree2_botRight, tree2_topLeft, tree2_topRight. Group them and call the group
			"objectTiles". Create another Tile Map ("Create -> Tile Map") and set it
			palette property to "|objectTiles". Set it's rowCount and columnCount to 8.
			Call this map "objectMap". Then select both maps (terrainMap and objectMap)
			and group them. Name the group "map1".
		<p>
			Select the objectMap and click "Make Live" button <img src="img/make_live.png">. 
			Then select objectTiles and choose "Window -> Brushes". Paint some trees
			and stones.
		<p><center><img src="img/tile_map2.png"></center>
		<p>
			When finished, select objectMap and press "Make Live" button again to
			disable painting on it.
		<h3><a id="step6"></a> Step 6. Creating animation</h3>
		We have a beautiful woodland scenery. Now we need somebody to vivify it.
		<p>
			Import following sprites: monk1, monk2, monk3, monk4. Group them,
			name the group "monk". Select "Edit -> Convert -> Transform to Animation".
			Expand the monk object to see that it consist of a 4 frames, and
			each frame has a "layer" object.
		<p><center><img src="img/monk.png"></center>
		<p>
			To view an animation click "Play" button <img src="img/play_but.png">
			in the right bootom part of a programm window. Well, this monk turns his
			head too fast. Click "Stop" button and let's tune the delay of the
			frames. To adjust the delay of the frame select it in the Outliner
			window and enter the delay value in the Property Editor.
		<h3><a id="step7"></a> Step 7. Putting all together</h3>
			Select map1, monk and panel objects. Group them.
			Use the Move Tool to place this	elements or enter x and y
			coords directly in the Property Editor.
		<p><center><img src="img/finished.png"></center>
		<h3><a id="step8"></a> Step 8. Exporting resources to the Mobile Dragon</h3>
			Choose "File -> Export Resources". This resources are exported to the "output" folder of the project. Now import this project in the Mobile Dragon and look at the best game in the world ! (Though it's more close to a screensaver :) ).
